## USAGE -
Upon visiting the webpage you are welcomed with a simple search and navigation bar. The user can simply type in a movie title or use the nav bar that allows them to filter the search by genre, year, and all trending Gifs. Once a user searches for a movie, results are then pulled from IMDB using OMDb's API server. The user can then see movie details including storyline, reviews, cast, fun facts, and details. This assists users that want a specific GIPHY related to a movie whether that be needing a list of all movie series, descriptions, and/or cast or they can simply click our "see all related" button which will display all tagged Gifs related to their search criteria. A perfectly curated GIPHY will then be ready to share.
